## Overview
A simple starter template of a SilverStripe project. This includes a basic .env.example with settings for a developer admin, a docker-compose to get started with a MySQL server, and a PSR-4 instruction for Composer to work with namespaced classes. Just remember to leave Page and PageController as is with their root namespace.
